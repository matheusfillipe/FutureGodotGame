# Unborn

Game developed for the itch.io godot wild jam of June 2022.

# Plot

You died and become a orb spirit in the spirit world. Angels will try to take you to heaven while demons want to take you to hell. You have the ability to absorb another spirits like you and use their energy to release an explosion to attack the enemies but you have to take care not to take in bad spirits.

You are seeking for a way to reincarnate. 

Explore an infinite generated world, open portals and remember that you cannot really kill your enemies.
